<h2>What is Low Level Design</h2>

<h4>In brief, it's the process of taking requirements and converting it into code (rather design of code than code itself).</h4>

<br><h2>Process</h2>

<h4>-> Use-Case Diagram</h4>
<h4>-> Class Diagram</h4>
<h4>-> Activity Diagram (only for complex designs)</h4>

<br><h2>Key aspects of LLD</h2>

<h4>-> Data structures: Defines the way data will be organized within the system (e.g., lists, trees, etc.).
</h4>
<h4>-> Algorithms: Specifies the step-by-step procedures for specific tasks.
</h4>
<h4>-> Classes and methods: LLD focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, detailing classes, their attributes (data members), and the methods (functions) that operate on that data.
</h4>
<h4>-> Interfaces: Defines how different parts of the system will interact with each other.
</h4>
<h4>-> Input/Output (I/O): Specifies how the system will handle user input and generate outputs.
